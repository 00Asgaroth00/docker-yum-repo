Version: 1.0.0, 2017-03-22
This initial release happened months ago however since I am going to be making some heavy changes I figured I would tag it to maintain the point in time.
Version: 2.0.0, 2018-03-18
This is almost a full re-write with many new features. The ruby script has been replaced by a go program, which will do an inital scan at start up and uses concurrency and file locking. I have added multi-stage build process for the container to bring down the final container size. I have also added controls for not enabling nginx (if file serving will be done another way and to save resouces) amd turning on debugging.
